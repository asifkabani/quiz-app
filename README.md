# Quiz App - Do You Know the 90's?
This is my first stab at a real web application.

## Hight Level:
* User starts on a screen where they click a button to start the quiz.
* Give user 10 questions with 4 choices each.
* User can only view one question at a time.
* User can't skip questions.
* User should see what question they are on (7-10) and their current score (5 correct, 2 incorrect).
* When a user submits an answer to a question, they should get feedback if answer was correct or not. If incorrect, show correct answer.
* Then move on to the next question.
* After the use has completed final question, they should be shown their overall score (how many questions they got right, out of total questions asked) and be able to start a new game.
